# QA Application using GenAI, Hugging Face, FAISS, and Gemini

This project is a **Question-Answering (QA) Application** designed to extract relevant information from web pages and generate clear, human-readable answers. It leverages the power of **web scraping**, **text embeddings**, **vector search**, and **LLMs** to deliver accurate responses based on user queries.

 *"Someone once told me: It's better to voice your needs than to silently endure your struggles."*

This project is built around this philosophy. When users have questions, they shouldn’t struggle to find answers buried across multiple sources. This system ensures their questions are heard—and answered.
